## Driving Sustainability Through Innovative Product Management: My Journey and Vision at Holtara

With a background in sociology and political science, complemented by an MBA and a master’s in project management, I have always been passionate about the intersection of technology, social impact, and sustainability. During my political science studies, **I analyzed ESG EU regulations from a theoretical perspective, focusing on implementation deficits and regulatory control mechanisms**. This deepened my understanding of the challenges companies face in adopting sustainability frameworks, which I now aim to tackle through product-driven solutions.

## Building a Strong Product Management Foundation

To formalize my skills, I completed the allWomen Product Management Bootcamp, where I developed expertise in **Agile methodologies, user research, product roadmapping, and prioritization frameworks**. This foundation allowed me to apply **data-driven decision-making and user-centered design** to product development. Additionally, earning my **Scrum Master certification** further strengthened my ability to **lead cross-functional teams** and drive Agile processes efficiently.

## Empowering Women in Product Management

Following my bootcamp, I **co-founded** [SheLeadsProduct.tech], a community-driven platform dedicated to empowering women in product management through networking, learning, and collaboration. Leading this initiative, I was **responsible for product strategy, roadmap development, and iterative improvements based on user research**. I also **designed and programmed the platform, built its brand identity, and led workshops and roundtable discussions to foster engagement and knowledge-sharing**. By moderating discussions, organizing events, and facilitating collaboration, I ensured that SheLeadsProduct.tech remained a user-focused and impact-driven space. This experience reinforced my **strategic thinking, leadership, and ability to drive user-centered product decisions at scale**, while also showcasing my capacity to lead cross-functional teams and **initiatives from concept to execution**.

## Driving Operational Efficiency at Scale

In my current role at State Street Bank, I have **led automation initiatives** that **streamlined payroll and benefits operations for over 800 employees, reducing processing time by 20%**. I have also managed **cross-functional collaboration\*** between HR operations, shared services, and external vendors, driving system enhancements and improving compliance. These experiences have honed my **analytical skills, ability to translate complex data into actionable insights**, and process optimization expertise—all of which are crucial in developing scalable sustainability solutions.

## Why Holtara? Merging Product, ESG, and Innovation

My **passion for sustainability is deeply rooted in my belief that technology should be a catalyst for positive environmental change**. I am particularly inspired by Holtara’s mission to provide best-in-class ESG reporting solutions and support companies in navigating sustainability challenges. The opportunity to enhance data collection, analysis, and reporting features within Holtara’s platform aligns perfectly with my goal of leveraging technology for measurable impact.
