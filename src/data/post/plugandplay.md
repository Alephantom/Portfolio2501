## Driving Innovation & Strategy at Plug and Play Tech Center

Innovation is the driving force behind corporate evolution, and Plug and Play Tech Center stands at the forefront of this transformation. With a background in Product Management, Social Sciences, and HR Analytics, I am eager to apply my expertise in strategy execution, stakeholder engagement, and research-driven insights to help organizations develop and implement impactful innovation initiatives.

## Strategy & Execution: Turning Ideas into Impact

My experience in developing and executing strategic roadmaps has been instrumental in my work. At She Leads Product, I co-founded a community focused on fostering learning and collaboration for aspiring and junior PMs. I have led the creation of structured frameworks for mentorship and knowledge sharing, ensuring clear objectives and measurable outcomes. These same principles—structured execution, adaptability, and impact-driven work—are key in corporate innovation strategies. I am excited to bring these skills to Plug and Play, crafting tailored innovation roadmaps that align with corporate challenges and business objectives.

## Workshop Facilitation & Stakeholder Engagement

Facilitating collaborative discussions and aligning diverse stakeholders is crucial in open innovation. I have designed and hosted interactive workshops, including strategy sprints, community discussions, and learning sessions that help drive decision-making. At Plug and Play, I would leverage this experience to lead ideation sessions, strategy formulation, and stakeholder alignment—ensuring seamless execution and measurable impact.

## Research & Insights: Leveraging Data for Strategic Decisions

Innovation thrives on data-backed decision-making. My background in HR Analytics and Product Research has equipped me with the skills to analyze market trends, emerging technologies, and corporate pain points. In my Product Management training, I built an MVP for a Learning Hub, utilizing user research, competitive analysis, and business modeling to ensure a user-centric approach. At Plug and Play, I aim to apply these methodologies to translate insights into actionable innovation strategies, helping businesses stay ahead of the curve.

## Business Development & Growth: Expanding Innovation Opportunities

Innovation is only as strong as its ability to scale and create value. At State Street Bank, I worked on cost optimization and process improvement initiatives, aligning business goals with operational efficiency. As an Innovation Services Associate, I would identify opportunities to expand Plug and Play’s innovation initiatives, craft innovation-driven proposals, and support business development efforts through strategic recommendations and proposal writing.

## Ready to Drive Innovation Together?

Plug and Play’s mission to bridge corporate challenges with cutting-edge solutions resonates deeply with my approach to problem-solving, strategy, and innovation execution. I would love the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your needs and how I can contribute to scaling impactful innovation programs.

Looking forward to connecting!

Best regards,
