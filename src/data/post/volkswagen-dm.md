## Driving Project Excellence at Volkswagen Digital:Hub

With a foundation in **product management, HR analytics, and Agile delivery**, I specialize in **crossfunctional collaboration, streamlining project workflows, and driving strategic execution at scale**. My structured, data-driven approach supports business value creation, operational efficiency, and the successful delivery of digital programs—perfectly aligned with Volkswagen’s innovation-driven culture.

## Agile Leadership & Technical Coordination

Through the allWomen Product Management Bootcamp and a **Scrum Master certification**, I gained strong proficiency in **Agile frameworks, roadmapping, and user research,** enabling me to lead teams through iterative development cycles and continuous improvement. I bring a delivery-first mindset, ensuring every initiative meets deadlines, budget, and stakeholder expectations.

## Building Platforms & Communities with Impact

As co-founder of SheLeadsProduct.tech, I **led end-to-end product strategy, design, and execution**. I was hands-on with platform development, user research, branding, and community engagement, ensuring value delivery through user-centered design and measurable outcomes. This experience shaped my ability to **lead technical product delivery, stakeholder engagement, and cross-team alignment**.

## Scalable Execution & Operational Optimization

At State Street Bank, I delivered **automation initiatives that reduced HR processing time by 20%**, collaborating across functions and with vendors to enhance systems and compliance. These results demonstrate my strength in **process optimization, data analysis**, and turning insights into scalable solutions—a direct match for Volkswagen Digital:Hub’s delivery goals.
